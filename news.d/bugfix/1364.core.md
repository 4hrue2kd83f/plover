New reworked RTF/CRE support:
- correctly handle multi-lines mappings
- detect syntax errors (with recovery)
- use `\n\n` for new paragraphs (instead of non-undoable `{#Return}{#Returns}`)
- similarly, use `\t` and `\n` for `\tab` and `\line`
- correctly escape `{}\` on save
- use custom ignored groups for Plover macros and metas
- use groups to improve round-tripping affixes (so there's no ambiguity when parsing back, e.g. `{^in^}fix` -> `{\cxds in \cxds}fix` instead of `\cxds in\cxds fix`)
