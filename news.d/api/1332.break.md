The custom `test` command implementation provided by `plover_build_utils.setup.Test` has been removed:
- support for it on setuptools' side has been deprecated since version 41.5.0
- the custom handling of arguments conflicts with the use of some pytest options (e.g. `-m MARKEXPR`)
- the workaround for pytest cache handling is not necessary anymore
