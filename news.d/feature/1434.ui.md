Improve accessibility:
- Disable tab-key navigation in tables, so focusing a table does not lock global tab-key navigation to it.
- Remove some container widgets, tweak focus rules to avoid extra unnecessary steps when using tab-key navigation (like selecting the dictionaries widget outer frame).
- In form layouts, link each widget to its label (like each option in the configuration dialog).
- Set the accessible name / description of focusable widgets.
- Use lists for the dictionaries widget, suggestions widget, and the paper tape.
